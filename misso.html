      <div class="tp">
        <p>
          I am thrilled to express my passion for coding, website development,
          and assisting others, as I believe I would be the perfect fit for this
          position. I am eager to share my knowledge and expertise with the
          members and inspire them to achieve their coding goals. My plan for
          the upcoming semester is to create bi-weekly videos on how to create
          cool effect or tips/tricks you can do using HTML, CSS, and JS. By
          doing so, members can refine their coding skills, debug errors, and
          take their abilities to new heights.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that managing this position alongside my class schedule
          could be challenging, but I am fully committed to delivering
          high-quality content and study materials. I will pre-record a plethora
          of videos during the summer and create comprehensive study materials,
          allowing me to post them throughout the semester with ease. Joining
          this team would be an incredible opportunity, and I am excited to be a
          part of it. I am eager to learn, motivated to help as many members as
          possible, and ready to make a positive impact!

          One idea for a workshop that I want to do is a step by step guide on
          how to create and host your own website similar to this website right
          here.
